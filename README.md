# Ex-Data-Plotting2
The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008.

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

 * Based on plot 1, it appears that there is, in fact, a <b>decrease</b> in total PM2.5 emissions in the United States from 1999 to 2008.
     * The most obvious decrease is on the <u>non-point</u> source of emissions. As the years pass, there is a significant decrease in total emissions from over 5 million in 1999, to 2.5 million in 2008.
     * The <u>point</u> source follows a sharp decrease from 1999 to 2002, but then increases slightly the following few years, evnetually petering off in 2005.
     * The <u>non-road</u> point shows a slow, but steady decrease from 1999 to 2008.
     * The <u>on-road</u> point shows a nearly linear decreasing pattern, albeit very minimal. 

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008? 

3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
