# Exploratory Data Analysis
The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008.

***
*1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?*
### Plot 1      
![plot of Plot1](/images/plot1.png)
Based on plot 1, it appears that there is in fact, a decrease in total PM2.5 emissions in the United States from 1999 to 2008.
+ The most obvious decrease is the **non-point** source of emissions. As the years pass, there is a significant decrease in total emissions from over 5 million in 1999, to 2.5 million in 2008.
+ The **point** source follows a sharp decrease from 1999 to 2002, then increases slightly the following few years, eventually petering off in 2005.
+ The **non-road** point shows a slow, but steady decrease from 1999 to 2008.
+ The **on-road** point shows a nearly linear decreasing pattern, albeit very minimal.
